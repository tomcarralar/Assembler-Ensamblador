# Assembler-Ensamblador

## Chain handler 
This project implements a program in MIPS assembly language that processes an input string provided by the user. The string is divided into several parts to determine the operation and operands, and various string manipulation tasks are performed, such as length calculation, case conversion, concatenation, comparison, and search operations.

## Solver for second degree equations
Implementation of a series of functions in MIPS assembly to solve systems of linear equations with two unknowns. I use an external library for the mathematical resolution of the system and focus on the implementation of input and output functions, as well as their integration with the resolution function.
